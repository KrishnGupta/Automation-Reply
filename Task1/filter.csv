In the Fall of 2022, the Department included in the President’s Regulatory Agenda the intent to have the proposed amended regulations out by May of 2023. That did not happen, and on June 14, 2023, the regulatory agenda was amended to reflect the intent to issue the proposed regulations in August 2023. Currently, the President’s Fall Unified Agenda most recently reflects an issuance date for the proposed regulations of November 2023.
