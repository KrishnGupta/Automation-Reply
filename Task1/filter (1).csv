Moving out of his family’s New Hampshire home. College. Establishing his career. Dating. Sex. Yet every rite of passage is fraught with challenges. Unexpected seizures and uncontrollable movements caused by his rare genetic disorder. Friends’ homes that are inaccessible to his wheelchair. His labored speech and use of a communication device are barriers to a social life. He craves more independence and a family of his own one day. “But no one tells you how to be an adult,” he says, “let alone an adult with a disability.” Samuel is determined to avoid the statistical realities: unemployment, isolation, institutionalization. A turning point comes when he starts talking to disabled adults, who have been through all he is going through now. And when he begins to channel their insights, a roadmap for himself, and for other youngadults like him, begins to take shape.REGISTER HERE    Sponsored    Zirkel’s Legal Alert - May 2024 Update for CASE           This month’s update identifies recent court decisions that respectively illustrate polar interpretations of various IDEA FAPE claims, including the increasing issue of student anxiety.

We are conducting a Delphi survey to obtain the informed opinions of experts in the field about (a) the essential components of the IEP that lead to the development and implementation of the IEP to promote academic and functional progress for students with disabilities, (b) the barriers that prevent the development and implementation of IEPs, and (c) the types of professional development that are needed for educators to promote progress. We need panel members to serve on our expert team. The following roles are needed: 1) parents of students with disabilities, 2) building level administrators, 3) special education administrators, 4) state department of education special education staff (not state directors), 5) institutions of higher education faculty/administrators, and 6) special education teachers.

We continue to monitor the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions.  Background Information:OCR announced on May 6, 2022 its intent to issue proposed revisions to the 45-year-old 504 regulations enacted in 1977. In the Fall of 2022, the Department included in the President’s Regulatory Agenda the intent to have the proposed amended regulations out by May of 2023. That did not happen, and on June 14, 2023, the regulatory agenda was amended to reflect the intent to issue the proposed regulations in August 2023. Currently, the President’s Fall Unified Agenda most recently reflects an issuance date for the proposed regulations of November 2023. Visit the CASE website for the most up-to-date information regarding Section 504 proposed regulations.LEARN MORE    Sponsored    Input Needed Regarding Medicaid Reimbursement!This survey is being commissioned by CASE for the purpose of gathering information    The Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) indicated they received comments regarding denial of Medicaid Services.
